							<h1>Covid-19 SQL Project</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/outbreak-coronavirus-world-1024x506px.jpg" alt="Virus image" /></span>
							<h2>Introduction</h2>
							<p>Covid-19 and the pandemic have impacted all of our lives - from personal tragedy in the loss of family and friends to loss of employment, closed businesses, shortages of goods and services, etc.
							One specific area where almost everyone has significantly been touched in some way has been in the loss of a family member or friend.</p>
							<p>I personally have family members who have served on the front line of the pandemic, working in the heathcare sector as nurses. Specifically, my
							sister has worked in the ICU of a small hospital in Georgia, USA. She has relayed many sad stories of the losses incurred during the pandemic, often with the
							patient passing without any family present.  </p>
							<p>The vaccines that were introduced for Covid-19 are a significant piece of this data that I am analyzing in this project. The dataset comes from <a href="https://ourworldindata.org" target="_blank">Our World In Data</a>, 
							and the specific dataset can be downloaded as a CSV file. I downloaded the dataset included in this SQL portfolio project on 26 March, 2022, so the data is some of the most current available. So, whether 
							you are skeptical of the vaccines, as some continue to be, I hope you will look at the data presented with the understanding that I am presenting the data 
							as collected and not making any scientific or political statements with my portfolio. Also, there are many other factors that come into play, such as immunity from COVID-19 infection. </p>
							<p>There are a number of risks in using this dataset. The risks include the collecting of data from multiple sources, as the data comes from multiple agencies from around the world. Therefore, the 
							reliability of the data cannot be confirmed, only reported on.</p>
							<h2>Specific comments on the dataset</h2>
							<p>The dataset was downloaded as a single .CSV file in which I split it into two Excel spreadsheets: one for Covid deaths and cases and the second for 
							Covid tests and vaccinations. I split them into two files (and subsequently two tables) to demonstrate use of SQL JOINs. I loaded the Excel spreadsheets into a Microsoft SQL Server database that I created using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.
							Initially, I used the SQL Server Import and Export Data tool to create the two tables and import the spreadsheets, but I wanted different
							data types for some of the fields other than the defaults used by the Import tool. I also excluded some of the columns in the spreadsheets that were not relevant for my analysis.
							Before importing the data, I created the DDL script to create the tables using the fields and data types I wanted for the data. In hindsight, I could have further reduced the number of fields imported into each table. </p>
							<p>In addition to the two tables created from the dataset, I also created a calendar lookup table, since many of the SQL statements rely on the entry_date for select and join criteria.  </p>
							
							<p><b>Below are the CREATE TABLE commands to create the three tables in SQL Server.</b></p>
